### Fundamentals about Rust Programming Language

#### Rust Programming Language: 
> Rust is a Systems Programming Language. 

A system programming language is a programming language used for system programming; such languages are designed for writing system software, which usually requires different development approaches when compared with application software.

> Rust provides Safety, Concurrency, and Speed.

Safety is guaranteed at compile time. Concurrency is obtained much more easily when safety is ensured. High speed is due to zero-cost abstractions and other things.
